# First we'll try to define the skeleton or basic structure of the project and then write the code.
# First we'll load our data inside this file, we'll do this by creating a 'class' to load the data.
# In the class we'll have constructor as well: def __init__(self) and we'll write pass b/c we just 
# want to leave it empty for now.
# Now we'll write another def function initiate_data_ingestion
