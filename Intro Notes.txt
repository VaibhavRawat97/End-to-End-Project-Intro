GitBash is used for Linux command and Command Prompt is used for Windows commands.
If you're not familiar with Linux command, use GitBash otherwise use Command prompt.

Lets start step by step:

1. First initialize the git (init) by giving the following command on GitBash - git init

Note:

VS Code gives us the option to publish the repository from VS Code itself

In order to fetch all the changes made directly in and through the GitHub Repository into VS Code, go to the GitBash Terminal and give the following command:
git pull

.sh is a shell script file format more on that later.

Now lets talk in detail abourt folder structure/project structure:

The Project structure that we'll discuss can be used everywhere whether its DL or ML.
When we implement a ML project, there are certain chronological steps involved. 

1. Data Ingestion
2. EDA
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Evaluation

A Pipeline is where we keep all the above 5 components to function together chronologically.

Now, there are two types of pipelines:

1. Training pipeline 
2. Testing/Prediction pipeline

All the above comprise of our Project Structure, apart from these there are other technical aspects also that will a part of the 
infrastructure of the project which we will discuss below:

1. Logger file - We use it to logging the information/metadata regarding the project(this is present in pretty much every project) 

2. Exception file - This is not a compulsory file(not necessary to write it) it depends on how we'll design our infrastructure and our project.

Note:

Whatever project/folder structure that we'll design will be a 'Modular Design'. What does Modularity mean ? 
Modularity means we'll create a separate module for each and every task i.e, we'll use a resuabe code and a reusable infrastructure.
Lets say our project is complex or there are several dependencies in our project, we'll segregate these dependencies so that the chances of our 
code stopping in the middle of its exection is minimum. 

So in essence if we create a modular structure, we can handle complex situations also as our projects becomes bigger and more complex.

3. Utils file - This is a utility file (for utility function) incase we want to load, save something or incase we want to read any file or save any file.
Utils file is like a helper in projects, whatever utility code is there, we can write it inside this file.

4. Setup.py file - This file is used to install the local packages.

5. requirements.txt 


                                              Project Structure(basic intro)


The first thing in our project structure will be our root directory. A root directory is the top-level directory in a file system. It's the starting point for organizing all files and folders on a computer.

The root directory is similar to the trunk of a tree, as the starting point where all branches originate from. All other folders grow outwards from the root directory. This structure makes finding files easier than having all files stored in the one directory.

Inside this root directory will be our GitHub.

	Inside our GitHub directory we'll have one more folder i.e, Workflow folder.

		Inside the Workflow folder we'll have our yaml file.


If we want to perform CI/CD i.e, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, we need to have a GitHub folder in our project directory.

yaml file is used for writing the script/configuration, this script will be available in key:value format(similar to json) 

Now, we have another file by the name of '.gitkeep' file which will be explained in detail below.

Lets say we're doing development at our local system and we've created one folder and we've pushed this folder from our local to GitHub. 

This folder won't be visible inside our GitHub because we can't push an empty folder inside our GitHub.

Lets try to explain this with an example. 

Lets say we write a function:

def xyz:

If we execute the above line of code, error will be generated. In order to avoid this, python has given us a keyword. 
If we want to pass a function with no functionality we'll do this:

def xyz:
	pass

Similarly, if we want to push an empty folder(with no file or anything inside) on our GitHub repository the way to do it is to keep it inside a 
.gitkeep file. 

Here's the ChatGPT definition of .gitkeep:

The .gitkeep file is used in Git repositories to maintain empty directories. Git doesn't track empty directories by default, so if you want to include an empty directory in your repository, you need to place a file inside it. Conventionally, people use .gitkeep as a placeholder file within these directories to signal Git to keep the directory even if it's empty. This is especially useful for project organization and ensuring that directory structures are maintained even if they don't contain any files at the moment.


Now lets get started with the file structure:

Initially we don't know about our CI/CD script like where we will be deploying our application or what kind of CI/CD script we have to write. 

	So, initially we'll keep .gitkeep file inside our workflow folder.

Now along with that we'll create our Notebook folder in our root directory, inside this Notebook folder we'll create our research.ipynb file.

	Inside the research.ipynb file we'll have EDA and other basic preprocessing steps.


Apart from this we'll be having one more folder in or Github repository i.e, src folder.

	Insisde this src folder, we'll create whatever project we have to create and name it appropriately also for e.g, Diamond Price Prediction.

	In this project we'll predict the price of diamonds based on different parameters.

		Now, inside the Diamond Price Prediction folder we'll have more folders based on functionality like:

			1. Components 

			Inside components, we'll be having a few more files:
	
				1. Data Ingestion.py 
				2. Pre-processing file
				3. Model Training file
 

			2. Pipeline Folder 
			
			Inside this folder will be our files related to pipeline:

				1. training.py
				2. prediction.py

			3. Exceptions.py

			4. Logger.py

			5. Utils.py(utility file)


Now, in the root directory we'll be having some more files:

1. requirements.txt

2. setup.py

This is the complete project structure which we'll be using. 



Q. Why does GitBash use Forward slash(/) whereas Command prompt uses Backward slash(\) ?

Answer


The difference in the use of forward slash (/) and backward slash () as directory separators in Git Bash and Command Prompt primarily arises from the historical conventions of their respective operating systems.

Git Bash: Git Bash is typically used on Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and macOS) or as part of Git for Windows, which emulates Unix-like behavior. In Unix-like systems, the forward slash (/) is used as the directory separator in file paths.

Command Prompt (Windows): Command Prompt, on the other hand, is the command-line interpreter for Windows operating systems. In Windows, the convention is to use the backward slash () as the directory separator in file paths.

These conventions stem from the historical development of each operating system and the different standards they adopted. However, both Git Bash and Command Prompt generally support using either forward slashes or backward slashes interchangeably for specifying file paths, so you can often use either style in both environments without issues.


Now lets focus on some more of the basics now that our basic code has been executed and pushed into our GitHub repository.

As we can see in our End-to-End-Project-Intro in our GitHub repository that we've created an __init__.py file inside every folder.

Lets go in detail and find out why we use this __init__.py file.

The .py file is called a module.

Lets look at the hierarchy in the folder:

(Folder)--
	(File/module/.py) 

Now this complete Folder inside which includes the File/module/.py is called the package.

Now the question arises what is a package ? 

For instance, Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, Tensorflow, etc are all also packages. Meaning we have a folder in which we're writing a code in .py file 
and inside it will be class/def function etc. Lets look at an example


Folder(Tensorflow)--
	.py(tensor.py)--
		class(mytensor)


Now if we want to import this class 'mytensor' we'll do it this way:

from tensorflow.tensor import mytensor 

Here, tenserflow is the module(which is our folder); tensor is the module name(which is our file); mytensor is the class name.

Lets look at one more example:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

Here, sklearn is the module, linear_model is the file and LinearRegression is the class name.

This complete one line of code above that I just explained is called a package. 


Now there are in-built packages in python like pandas, numpy, etc but lets assume I want to create/establish my own package inside a folder that I have created. 

In order to make/transform the folder we've created into a local/custom package just like many in-built packages of python like numpy, pandas, etc.
We have to create __init__.py file inside our folder in order to transform our folder into a package.

Now that I have created my own custom/local package, how can I install this package ? 

Answer There are three ways:

1. pip install .

2. If we want to install it through requirements.txt then we'll do: -e .

3. We can use setup.py file and we can install our local package from setup.py file also i.e, if we run the following:
	python setup.py install 
By also running the above command we can install our local command inside our local environment.


Now lets take a step back and make our horizon wider...

Q. Why should we want to install a local package ? (if we wanted/needed to)

Ans

Firstly, whenever we want to write the 'import' statement, it gives an issue/error, in order to resolve the issue we install the local package.

Secondly, if we want to publish this package. 

For instance if we're doing development in Java we'll go through the following steps:

First we always create a 'jar' file if we're writing a code in Java or even Hadoop.
Now in the development,
	First step - development
	Second step - testing
	Third step - Q/A
	Fourth step - Delivery
	Fifth step - Deployment
	Sixth step - Monitoring
	Seventh step - Maintenance
	
From the First to Seventh step is called a 'Complete DevOps Pipeline'.

Here, First to Third steps are called 'Development'

And Fourth to Seventh steps are called 'Operations'


So, whenever we're doing development in Python we always pass our code in testing in terms of packages.

Whereas in Java we always pass the code in terms of jar file.

We can create our environment through init_setup.sh by writing the following command in bash(take a look inside the init_setup.sh as well):

bash init_setup.sh

Similarly by writing 'python setup.py install' in bash the following will be installed(as given in the setup.py file):

setup(
    name='DimondPricePrediction',
    version='0.0.1',
    author='sunny savita',
    author_email='sunny.savita@ineuron.ai',
    install_requires=["scikit-learn","pandas","numpy"],
    packages=find_packages()
) 


Now lets type 'pip list' in our bash to see what packages(in-built and/or local) have been installed and are functional:

As we can see in this long list of packages that our local package i.e, 'DimondPricePrediction  0.0.1' is also present.

Q. Why did we install it in the first place ? 
Ans

Because now it won't give us an issue if we 'import' this package.

We have one more way of installing our local/custom made package i.e,  DimondPricePrediction.

Open requirements.txt and write the following:

-e . 

(Here, '-e' means editable and . means for the current directory)

Now we'll go to bash and again run the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install our package again once we've deleted it earlier.
